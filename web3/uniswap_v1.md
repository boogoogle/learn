## Diving into Decentralized Exchanges (Uniswap V1)
### V1
- it only allowed swaps between ***ether and a token***
- chained swaps also possible to allow token-token swaps
    - it allow for a `TokenA <> TokenB` swap by:
        1. first, swap TokenA for ETH
        2. swap the ETH for TokenB
### v2
- a huge improment of V1 that allowed ***direct swaps*** between any ERC20 tokens
### V3
- significantly improved capital efficiency, which
    - allowd liquidity providers to remove a bigger portion of their liquidity from pools and 
    - still keep getting the same rewards.

### LP Tokens （Liquidity Provider Tokens）
- nobody would put tokens in a third-party contract if they are not getting something out of it.
- distribute fees amongst the liquidity providers. // 在流动性提供者之间分配费用
